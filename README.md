# eVote-Digital Democracy
Online election systems aim to modernize and streamline the electoral process by offering a secure, transparent, and accessible voting platform. These systems provide significant benefits by allowing voters to participate from any location with internet access, effectively eliminating geographical barriers. This increased accessibility leads to higher voter turnout and more efficient election management. By incorporating strong security measures such as encryption, secure databases, and user authentication, these platforms ensure the integrity of election results and build voter trust in the system. The goal is to safeguard the process from potential fraud or manipulation while offering a seamless voting experience.

User Roles and Permissions

Admin Role:

- The Admin is responsible for overseeing and managing the entire election process. This includes creating elections, adding or removing candidates, and handling sensitive data like voter information.
- Admins can also view real-time election results and are often tasked with ensuring the overall security and fairness of the system.
- Key responsibilities may involve managing user roles, handling system maintenance, and monitoring any irregularities during the voting process.
  
Voter Role:

- Voters are the end users who register on the system to participate in the election.
- They must first sign up through a registration process and then log in with their credentials to access the voting page.
- After logging in, voters can securely cast their ballots. Each voter is limited to one vote per election, and the system ensures that their vote is anonymous.
- The voter interface is typically simple, allowing them to view candidates and cast their vote quickly and efficiently.
  
Candidate Role:

- Candidates are the individuals running in the election and can be viewed by voters.
-Their role in the system is largely passive after elections begin, but their profiles are available for voters to learn more about them before casting their vote.

User Registration and Authentication

Registration Form:

- The registration process is an essential first step for users (voters) to gain access to the system. This form is typically built using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.
- The registration form will capture critical details such as the voter’s name, email, phone number, and password. More advanced systems may require government ID verification or other authentication methods to ensure the legitimacy of registered voters.
- Input validation (using HTML and JavaScript) ensures that users submit the correct format for required fields, preventing registration errors.
  
Login System:

- The login system is developed using PHP and MySQL to handle secure user authentication and session management.
- When a user logs in, their credentials are checked against the database (MySQL), where their details are securely stored. 
- Once authenticated, the user is granted access to the voting platform. A session is initiated to track the user’s activity, ensuring that they remain logged in and can cast a vote during their session.
- This login system also ensures that each voter can only vote once, as the system will recognize users who have already participated and block any additional voting attempts.
  
Together, these features create a robust and secure online election system that encourages greater participation, transparency, and trust in the voting process.
